# Project Title: How does your music taste compare?

## What and why?
The goal of the web app is to take a users' Spotify account and compare their most listened to songs with the overall most listened to songs on Spotify. This web app will help people understand how their taste in music compares with the rest of the world.

## For whom?
This software will be for Spotify users (most likely teenagers and young adults) who are curious about how their taste in music compares with others.

## How?
This software will be built using express.js backend and react.js frontend. It will also use the Spotify API to gather user data to compare with the overall data. The software will take the users' most listened to songs on spotify and compare with overall most listened to songs. If the software is not complex enough, the songs can possibly be split into genres to see if they are commonly listened to in a specific genre.

## Scope
The software will be using both express.js and React to design the web application. It will also implement the Spotify API which will need to be self-studied.
